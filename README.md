# The Python Beginner's First Project Setup (working title)

## Intro
*Simple Script Paradise Island.*

Every Python programmer starts out their Python journey here - simple one-file scripts written purely in Python,
using only the packages present in the Python Standard Library. 

In Paradise Island, everything is perfect - after all, they don't call it paradise for nothing! The weather is a 
balmy 20C/77F with clear skies all day every day. You sip your pina-colada upon the beach, with nary a worry in your 
mind, enjoying the occasional gentle sea breeze and a dip in the sea.

Some stay here longer than others. Those learning programming for the first time will enjoy a longer stay than 
those who come learning Python as an additional language.

But sooner or later, everyone must leave.

Somewhere out there in the distance is the *Realm of Projects*. A land several hundreds of times larger than Simple Script 
Paradise, this is where structured project development happens. Multi-file projects, multi-developer projects, 
and projects with external dependencies - code written by others, for usage in Python programs, 
not present in a standard Python installation. Here, it all happens, and it happens perfectly (for the most part).

There's only one problem - that which lies between Paradise Island and the Realm of Projects.

*The Gulf of Abject Misery and Treachery.*

## Prerequisites
Strictly speaking, there are no prerequisites for this guide. However, since this is aimed at people who want to be able
to code more complex Python projects, there are things you should learn first.

### Python

The most obvious of these is Python itself - you should really know enough Python first and be comfortable in coding 
simple single-file scripts that have no dependencies. 

If you aren't sure what level you are at, then ask yourself the 
following - can you write a simple terminal calculator app using Python? 

If you can, then great - my guide is for you. 
If you can't, you should focus on learning enough Python first - any good Python learning resource will do.

### Git

The other thing you need to know is version control. 99.9% of the time, this means Git. 

If you want to code anything other than the simplest of simple projects, then you need to know version control - there are no exceptions to the rule. 

You should
know to set up a Git repo, how to clone an existing GitHub repo, checking-out branches, committing files, pushing changes to GitHub, fetching updates from a GitHub repo and pulling/merging changes from a GitHub project into your local project.

If any of those seem unfamiliar, please seek out and follow any good Git learning resource before proceeding.
